#1942 Retro shooting plane game by XIA SI ZHE 20476377

## 1.**Project Description**
This project is based on an improved version of the classic game 1942, where the player has to control the plane to avoid enemy shells and fire them to destroy enemy planes. 
The version I got had a lot of bugs and lacked a certain amount of playability, so this project was developed with fixing bugs, refactoring the code, and adding features in mind.

Main goals: 

-fix most of the visible bugsã€‚
-improve readability and maintainability of the code. 
-Add new game features. 
-Modify and rebuild the UI of the game interface.
